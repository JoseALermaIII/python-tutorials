# Introduction

These are sets of problems given in [Udacity's CS101 Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101).
Unfortunately, Python 2.x is used in the course, so these problem sets may not be forwards compatible.

It is fantastic that classes can be taken for free, though a machine does all the grading. The only downside is that there is
little feedback, but that may be what the forums are for.

Included are my answers to the given problems. As I learn more about Python, 
I will go back and make corrections/improvements. Regardless, given these are tutorials, feedback is welcome.
