It is fantastic that classes can be taken for free, though a machine does all the grading. The only downside is that there is
little feedback, but that may be what the forums are for.

Included are my answers to the given problems. As I learn more about Python, 
I will go back and make corrections/improvements. Regardless, given these are tutorials, feedback is welcome.

## CS101: Intro to Computer Science
These are sets of problems given in [Udacity's CS101 Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101).
Unfortunately, Python 2.x is used in the course, so these problem sets may not be forwards compatible.

The goal of the CS101 class is to create an Internet search engine from scratch in Python. While the basics of Python are covered,
I still recommend reading a primer on Python programming to better understand how programs are written.

To that end, I recommend [Cracking Codes with Python by Al Sweigart](http://inventwithpython.com/cracking/) because it
demonstrates in-depth usage of strings, lists, and dictionaries with full explanations in a short-form book.
