## CS101
These are sets of problems given in [Udacity's CS101 Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101).
Unfortunately, Python 2.x is used in the course, so these problem sets may not be forwards compatible.

The goal of CS101 class is to create an Internet search engine from scratch in Python. While the basics of Python are covered,
I still recommend reading a primer on the Python language to more easily write programs by understanding
how they are written.

To that end, I recommend [Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

It is fantastic that classes can be taken for free, though a machine does all the grading. The only downside is that there is
little feedback, but that may be what the forums are for.

Included are my answers to the given problems. As I learn more about Python, 
I will go back and make corrections/improvements. Regardless, given these are tutorials, feedback is welcome.
