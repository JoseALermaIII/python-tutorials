Vim
===

`Vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_ is a configurable, open source, and cross platform text editor that is an improvement of
the vi editor in most Linux distros.

It has nifty things like syntax highlighting, colorization, and a scripting language to make your own plugins, etc.

Setup
-----

As aforementioned, it is cross platform (and open source), so it can run on anything (even Potato).
Personally, I prefer to use it on Linux only because it is usually in the default repository and has both syntax
highlighting and colorization, which are a great improvement upon vi in CLI.

Linux
^^^^^

If your distro does not have vim in its default repo, then I fear you will have to compile from `source code
<http://www.vim.org/download.php#unix>`_.

Windows
^^^^^^^

If you should want to use Vim on Windows, and not use `gVim at PA.com
<http://portableapps.com/apps/development/gvim_portable>`_, then `both binaries and executables
<http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc>`_ are available for you.

Other
^^^^^

Believe it or not, Vim is available on even more architectures: `Amiga <http://www.vim.org/download.php#amiga>`_,
`OS2 <http://www.vim.org/download.php#os2>`_, `Macintosh <http://www.vim.org/download.php#mac>`_,
`Android, iOS, WindowsCE, Cygwin, and others <http://www.vim.org/download.php#others>`_.

Plugins/Scripts
---------------

Vim has a library of thousands of powerful `scripts <http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php>`_ that are easy to make if
it is missing something you want. Personally, I do not use any since I mainly use Vim as a quick, light editor.
