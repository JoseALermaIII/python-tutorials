#Introduction
This is a set of examples from Wikibook's 
[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3).

I like the concept of an open tutorial for users to learn from and add to so I went along with it and typed up all the 
relevant examples from all the chapters with code.

They are a great resource to follow along with and contain some notes I added.
