Introduction
============

Python is a great language for getting things done quickly; however, a good deal of resources (mainly
:abbr:`RAM (Random Access Memory)`) are recommended. There are ways to incorporate C/C++ from within Python, but some
may find it easier to port it over.

For more thorough intros, get lost in `Python's Beginner's Guide <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_ or
`Wikipedia's Python page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>`_ for a day or so and come back.
