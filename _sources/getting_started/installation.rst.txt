Installation
============

There are many ways to install and use Python depending on platform and :abbr:`IDE (Integrated Development Environment)`
(if any). These docs cover the methods I frequently use.

Windows
-------

For Windows, I use but one editor: :doc:`atom_setup`; however, I give
:doc:`pycharm_setup` an honorable mention. The Atom setup is lightweight and portable while the Pycharm
setup is extensible and full-featured.

I have Pycharm on a Windows 10 Technical Preview :abbr:`VM (Virtual Machine)`, and it works well, but is quite bloated
for a Windows VM running in Windows (Windows-ception?).

Linux
-----

For Linux, I have two main IDEs: :doc:`vim_setup` and :doc:`pycharm_setup`.
The Vim setup is lightweight and available without too much effort while the PyCharm setup is extensible and
full-featured.

While I have a couple of Linux boxes (at the moment), I am very security minded when it comes to my Linux machines, so
I prefer to run a Development VM of Linux on Windows. Excessive, yes, but taking snapshots, cloning, and
reinstalling on VMs is easier than on physical machines.

I've read that some python bots can be run on a Raspberry Pi. I would like to tinker with this concept a bit, but I am
concerned that Raspberry Pis do not have enough RAM, so I will be sticking with VMs until I can get more tests done.

Disclaimer
----------

Though covered by the MIT License, I reiterate: executable programs written from code on the Internet can end up doing
bad things.

  Read and understand all code you copy and paste before running it.
