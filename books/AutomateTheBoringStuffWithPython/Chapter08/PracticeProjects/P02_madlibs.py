# Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own
# text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file.
#
# For example, a text file may look like this:
# The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was
# unaffected by these events.
#
# The program would find these occurrences and prompt the user to replace them.
# Enter an adjective:
# silly
# Enter a noun:
# chandelier
# Enter a verb:
# screamed
# Enter a noun:
# pickup truck
#
# The following text file would then be created:
# The silly panda walked to the chandelier and then screamed. A nearby pickup
# truck was unaffected by these events.
# The results should be printed to the screen and saved to a new text file.
