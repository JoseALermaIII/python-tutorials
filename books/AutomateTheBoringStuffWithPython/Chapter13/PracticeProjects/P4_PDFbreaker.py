# Say you have an encrypted PDF that you have forgotten the password to, but you
# remember it was a single English word. Trying to guess your forgotten password
# is quite a boring task. Instead you can write a program that will decrypt the
# PDF by trying every possible English word until it finds one that works.
#
# Create a list of word strings by reading dictionary.txt. Then loop over each word in
# this list, passing it to the decrypt() method. If this method returns the integer
# 0, the password was wrong and your program should continue to the next password.
# If decrypt() returns 1, then your program should break out of the loop and print
# the hacked password. You should try both the uppercase and lower-case form of
# each word.
