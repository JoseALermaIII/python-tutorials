# Using the os.walk() function, write a script that will go through every PDF
# in a folder (and its subfolders) and encrypt the PDFs using a password provided
# on the command line. Save each encrypted PDF with an _encrypted.pdf suffix added
# to the original filename.
#
# Before deleting the original file, have the program attempt to read and decrypt the
# file to ensure that it was encrypted correctly.
