# This program makes a Collatz Sequence for a given number

# Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number.
# If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value.
# If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.

# Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling
# collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.

# Sample output:
# Enter number:
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1
