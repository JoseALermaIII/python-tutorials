# This program adds input validation to make_collatz_seq.py

# Add try and except statements to the previous project to detect whether
# the user types in a noninteger string. Normally, the int() function will
# raise a ValueError error if it is passed a noninteger string, as in int('puppy').
# In the except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an integer.
