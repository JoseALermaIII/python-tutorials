# This program converts a list to a comma separated string
#
# Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string
# with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before
# the last item.
#
# Say you have a list value like this:
# spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']
# For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return
# 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work
# with any list value passed to it.
