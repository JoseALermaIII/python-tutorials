# Regex Version of strip() - this program acts like the strip() method but using regex
#
# Write a function that takes a string and does the same thing as the strip() string
# method. If no other arguments are passed other than the string to strip, then
# whitespace characters will be removed from the beginning and end of the string.
# Otherwise, the characters specified in the second argument to the function will be
# removed from the string.
