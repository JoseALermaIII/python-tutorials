# Strong Password Detection - this program ensures passwords entered are "strong"
#
# Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string
# it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight
# characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least
# one digit. You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate
# its strength.
