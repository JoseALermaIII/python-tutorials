# 2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down, left, or
# right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score by repeatedly
# sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over again.
# Write a program that will open the game at https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/
# and keep sending up, right, down, and left keystrokes to automatically play the game.
