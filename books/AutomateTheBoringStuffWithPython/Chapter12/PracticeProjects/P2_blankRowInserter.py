# Create a program blankRowInserter.py that takes two integers and a filename
# string as command line arguments. Letâ€™s call the first integer N and the second
# integer M. Starting at row N, the program should insert M blank rows into the
# spreadsheet.

# Get arguments from commandline
#N = int(''.join(sys.argv[0]))
#M = int(''.join(sys.argv[1]))
#file = ''.join(sys.argv[2])
