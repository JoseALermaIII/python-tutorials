# Write a program that takes a list of people’s email addresses and a list of chores
# that need to be done and randomly assigns chores to people. Email each person their
# assigned chores.
#
# If you’re feeling ambitious, keep a record of each person’s previously assigned
# chores so that you can make sure the program avoids assigning anyone the same chore
# they did last time.
#
# For another possible feature, schedule the program to run once a week automatically.
