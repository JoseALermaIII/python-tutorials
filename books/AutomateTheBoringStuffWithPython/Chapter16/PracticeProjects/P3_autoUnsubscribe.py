# Write a program that scans through your email account, finds all the unsubscribe
# links in all your emails, and automatically opens them in a browser. This program
# will have to log in to your email providerâ€™s IMAP server and download all of your
# emails. You can use BeautifulSoup to check for any instance where the word
# unsubscribe occurs within an HTML link tag.
#
# Once you have a list of these URLs, you can use webbrowser.open() to automatically
# open all of these links in a browser.
