# This program displays a list of strings in a table
#
# Write a function named printTable() that takes a list of lists of strings and
# displays it in a well-organized table with each column right-justified. Assume
# that all the inner lists will contain the same number of strings.
#
# For example, the value could look like this:
# tableData = [['apples', 'oranges', 'cherries', 'banana'],
#              ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David'],
#              ['dogs', 'cats', 'moose', 'goose']]
#
# Your printTable() function would print the following:
#   apples Alice  dogs
#  oranges   Bob  cats
# cherries Carol moose
#   banana David goose
