# Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix, such as spam001.txt,
# spam002.txt, and so on, in a single folder and locates any gaps in the numbering
# (such as if there is a spam001.txt and spam003.txt but no spam002.txt).
#
# Have the program rename all the later files to close this gap.
