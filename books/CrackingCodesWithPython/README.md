You'll be seeing a lot of [Al Sweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart)'s books because he provides them for free
online at [his website](http://inventwithpython.com/). Please consider donating to show your support.

[Cracking Codes with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/cracking/) is his latest release and largely covers how to use
and compromise various ciphers with Python.

Granted, most of the ciphers are old enough to be broken with a Raspberry Pi, but the general idea is how they are
implemented and what about them are easy to break.
