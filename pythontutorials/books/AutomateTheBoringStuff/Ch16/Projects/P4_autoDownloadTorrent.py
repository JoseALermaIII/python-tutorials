"""Auto download torrent

Write a program that checks an email account every 15 minutes for any instructions
you email it and executes those instructions automatically.

For example, BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer downloading system. Using free BitTorrent
software such as qBittorrent, you can download large media files on your home computer.
If you email the program a (completely legal, not at all piratical) BitTorrent link,
the program will eventually check its email, find this message, extract the link, and
then launch qBittorrent to start downloading the file. This way, you can have your
home computer begin downloads while youâ€™re away, and the (completely legal, not at
all piratical) download can be finished by the time you return home.

Notes:
    * Shutting down after downloading is considered "Hit 'n' run" and goes against torrenting.

        * Consider setting up a seed ratio limit and let it stop sharing afterward.

    * `Transmission`_ torrent client is used since it is available in `Ubuntu`_ by default.

        * A bash script is ultimately needed to shutdown Transmission.
        * Remote access is needed to run the bash script (hint).
