CrackingCodesWithPython
=======================
You'll be seeing a lot of `Al Sweigart <https://twitter.com/AlSweigart>`_'s books because he provides them for free
online at `his website <http://inventwithpython.com/>`_. Please consider donating to show your support.

`Cracking Codes with Python <http://inventwithpython.com/cracking/>`_ is his latest release and largely covers how to
use and compromise various ciphers with Python.

Granted, most of the ciphers are old enough to be broken with a Raspberry Pi, but the general idea is how they are
implemented and what about them are easy to break.
